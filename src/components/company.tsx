              Warren Togami is the creator of the Fedora Linux distribution, which is widely used in servers, supercomputers, and embedded devices. He is known for his dedication to open-source software and his contributions to the development of free and open-source software.
              <br />
              <br />
              Warren is best known as the creator of the Fedora Project during 2002 as his BS Computer Science
              capstone. Fedora grew into one of the world&apos;s largest Open Source projects and force multiplier of Red
              Hat R&D during the 2000&apos;s. This played an important role in early Linux quickly progressing from
              hobbyist volunteer side-projects to out-compete the previously entrenched enterprise Unix market.
